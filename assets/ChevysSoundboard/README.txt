Thank you for using my soundboard.

here are some things you need to know.

1. please do not, i mean ever steal this product without credit (example: "credit to: chevy")
2. i worked hard on this, if you steal/copy this product, just please give credit. stealing people's work is bad. dont ever copy people's stuff, and claim it is yours. never
do that in your life.
3. Have fun with the soundboard!
